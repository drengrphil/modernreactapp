A simple TODO app built using React with Redux

This is a simple app built from a course, and it covers **React Ecosystems**: 
     * Redux: to handle state management
     * Redux thunk: for side-effect management (including network request)
     * React selectors/reselect
     * Styled-component
     * and testing.
