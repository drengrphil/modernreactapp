A simple TODO app built using React with Redux

This is a simple app built from a course, and it covers React Ecosystems: 
     1.  Redux: to handle state management
     2.  Redux thunk: for side-effect management (including network request)
     3.  React selectors/reselect
     4.  Styled-component
     5. and testing.
